def calculate_test_statistics(scores):
    """
    Calculate statistics for a list of test scores.

    This function takes a list of test scores and calculates various statistics
    including the average score, highest and lowest scores, and counts how many
    students passed or failed.

    Purpose:
        Help teachers quickly analyze test results to understand class performance.
        A passing score is 60 or above.

    Parameters:
        scores: A list of numbers representing test scores (0-100 scale)

    Returns:
        A dictionary with the following keys:
        - 'average': The average (mean) score
        - 'highest': The highest score
        - 'lowest': The lowest score
        - 'passed': Number of scores >= 60
        - 'failed': Number of scores < 60
        - 'pass_rate': Percentage of students who passed

    Example:
        >>> scores = [75, 82, 55, 90, 68]
        >>> result = calculate_test_statistics(scores)
        >>> print(result['average'])
